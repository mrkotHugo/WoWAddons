## Changes

Updated for patch 10.1.0.

Added token and trinket data from Aberrus the Shadowed Crucible

### Require note per response

It's now possible to require notes per specific response - check `Buttons and Response` options and check `Require Notes` for each response you want raiders to submit a note with.  
Old require notes option has been removed as part of this change.

Note: This will not work for people with older versions.

### Void-Touched Curio

Removed from blacklist.

## Bugfixes

- *Fixed occasional inability to trade multiple identical items.*
- *`/rc fulltest` should once again pull items from the latest raid.*
